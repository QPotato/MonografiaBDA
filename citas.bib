    abstract="The search for a better understanding of natural and human phenomena is the main purpose of science. Today, a wide range of operational GIS applications used for scientific research, business and planning illustrates the usefulness of this technology to study characteristics of geographical distributions. However, real world entities are located and are evolving in both space and time. Users are thus quite often unsatisfied with the traditional static two-dimensional, map-oriented representation of nature and want to integrate temporal dimension and modelling of changes within GIS applications. In contrast, environmental modelling deals with the numerical simulation of three-dimensional, (space) time-dependent processes with roots in atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, soil, biologic, ecological, and other natural sciences (Goodchild et al. 1996). Contemporary simulation modelling emphasises interdisciplinary approaches combining atmospheric, hydrologic and ecological models that can be linked across various temporal and spatial scales to measure, understand and predict interactions between the biosphere and other Earth subsystems. To fulfil these needs, GIS technology, mainly based on the traditional concept of map layers and static databases, has to evolve in two ways:to support open interoperability between systems, using appropriate data structures that can be addressed externally and linked into existing environmental models; andto include functions to handle time, change and events in order to describe real world processes using database technology.",

      abstract = {Nowadays, many applications need data modeling facilities  for the description of complex objects with spatial and/or  temporal facilities. Responses to such requirements may be  found in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), in some  DBMS, or in the research literature. However, most of  existing models cover only partly the requirements (they  address either spatial or temporal modeling), and most are  at the logical level, hence not well suited for database  design. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal modeling  approach at the conceptual level, called MADS. The proposal  stems from the identification of the criteria to be met for  a conceptual model. It is advocated that orthogonality is  the key issue for achieving a powerful and intuitive  conceptual model. Thus, the proposal focuses on  highlighting similarities in the modeling of space and  time, which enhance readability and understandability of  the model.},
